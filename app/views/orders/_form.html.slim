      * Ticket prices are the same for all [3 levels](#{program_path}).
      * __* Important!__ We have a very limited number of seats! If you want to secure your place in the program, but
    you want us to help you pay, _you still need to register_! If you don't, tickets might get sold out in the
    meantime, or while we process your request.
      * If the prices are too high for you, we might be able to help you out by allowing you to pay in installments.
    Walk through all the steps of registration until you see a button that says "Pay now". Below that button you
    will find instructions.
