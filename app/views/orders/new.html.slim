          | About Tickets & Pricing

        markdown:
          * Ticket prices are the same for all [3 levels](#{program_path}).
          * __* Important!__ We have a very limited number of seats! If you want to secure your place in the program, but
          you want us to help you pay, _you still need to register_! If you don't, tickets might get sold out in the
          meantime, or while we process your request.
          * If the prices are too high for you, we might be able to help you out by allowing you to pay in installments.
            Walk through all the steps of registration until you see a button that says "Pay now". Below that button you
            will find instructions.
          * We are a **low-profit** community organization. Meaning we won't earn much by selling you these tickets.
          * Ticket prices help us pay for the venue, the catering, and the WiFi. Speakers, coaches, and mentors
            do not get paid. Our cost are over â‚¬ 100,000.00.
          * If we sell over 100 tickets, we will start giving out more discounts to minorities, pay volunteers,
            and compensate people who already bought a ticket so they might benefit from discounts even if they
            already bought their ticket.
          * Our number one purpose is to contribute to development education. Giving you a valuable experience for an
            affordable price is paramount to us.
