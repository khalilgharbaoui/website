        h2 About The Programs

        markdown:
          We have three programs that will get you to the point where you will
          be able to switch your career to programming if you'd want to.

          Every program ends with a contest. Winners of the contest will get help
          from us and our sponsors to give you everything you need to start
          growing your own career in development.

          [Level One](#level-one) will teach you the basics of programming, and
          how tho _think_ like programmer. By the end of the week, you will be
          able to start writing small programs to make your lives easier.

          In [Level Two](#level-two) we will start with the basics of building
          a web application. Your code will come alive on the internet, where
          the world will be able to see what you built. An exciting week, after
          which you will have built a couple of applications, and released them
          to the public internet.

          Finally, [Level Three](#level-three) is where we will start preparing
          you for the professional programming world out there. You will add
          more complicated technology to your applications, and you will learn
          about the latest hi-tech developments and how to use them.
