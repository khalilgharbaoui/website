We will pause only for lunch, coffee, and tea. During the evenings we will have various cool keynotes and presentations on lighter subjects between 8pm and 10pm.

          By the end of the week you will have built your own website, and you will know how to grow and maintain it. One year of hosting is included in the program so your website will stay online for that time and you will be able to show it to your friends, family, even start your own business maybe?
