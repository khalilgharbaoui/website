      h2 Code is Everywhere

      markdown:
        Every piece of technology that you use every day has software on it. Computers,
        phones, cars, refrigerators, watches all run software large and small, complex
        and simple. You probably want to play a role in that.

      h2 Learn Together

      markdown:
        It's more fun and inspiring to learn together. And
        it goes a lot faster than learning code online.

        We put real, working software engineers in front of
        the classroom to give you the most up to date learning
        experience available.
