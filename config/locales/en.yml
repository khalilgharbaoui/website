# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  beginner_bootcamp_tagline: your kickstart into coding

  beginner_bootcamp_description: |
    The Beginner Bootcamp is a unique kickstart into the world
    of coding. It is for all of you who start coding with little or
    no experience.

    Whether you want to understand a bit more about programming or
    want to start changing your career around, this is the best
    primer you can get: it's cheap, it's short, it's fun, and you
    learn from the best.

    We will cover all the basic parts of a web application. By the
    end of the week you will have built your own website, and you
    will know how to grow and maintain it.

    One year of hosting is included in the program so your website
    will stay online for that time and you will be able to show it
    to your friends, family, or even start your own business maybe?

    Check out the topics on this page. Right now, most of them might
    seem very foreign to you, but soon you will understand all of this,
    and it will only take you 7 days, plus our help.

    Don't linger any longer, enroll in our bootcamp!

  intermediate_bootcamp: Intermediate Bootcamp
  intermediate_bootcamp_tagline: build applications that matter
  intermediate_bootcamp_intro: ...teaches you about building and deploying different types of web applications. On the frontend you learn to build interactive components with Javascript. On the backend we teach you to store and retrieve data from databases.

    To become a true web developer, you need to make miles and you will, this
    week! Every day of the week we look at a certain part of an application:
    interactive frontend with Javascript, the database, deploying your app to a
    server, etc. The result of each day is a live and kicking web application
    that works.

    We cover everything that’s needed to build rich applications that implement
    the necessary functionality and logic to start at least a very interesting
    side project, but quite possibly even the first version of an online
    business.

    Not only do you learn the necessary skills, but also the industry standard
    ways to solve common functionality like allowing users to create accounts
    and sign in, image uploads, and more.

    Intermediate Bootcamp is the ultimate follow-up of the Beginner Bootcamp.
    If you have not completed our Beginner Bootcamp, but still got some basic
    programming skills, we might still take you in as a student. Please contact
    us so we can schedule a call with you to determine your current level.
    There is a good chance that we ask you to do some pre-work before we take
    you in.

    To become a professional web developer, you need to have more than
    programming skills. You need to be able to work together in a team, how an
    application is designed, built, secured, and maintained. You also need to
    know a little bit about the environment your applications need to run:
    services.

    In Advanced Bootcamp we cover agile product development techniques,
    design/UX, and working together on code with git flow. We will also build a
    more complex, production-ready application.

    After Advanced Bootcamp, you are ready to become a Junior developer at one
    of the thousands of companies in the Netherlands and abroad that are dying
    to have you. They will take you in and train you more so you can follow your
    true passion to build beautiful interfaces or systems that make our world go
    round.

    Advanced Bootcamp is the ultimate follow-up of the Intermediate Bootcamp.
    If you have not completed our Intermediate Bootcamp, but still got some
    programming skills, we might still take you in as a student. Please contact
    us so we can schedule a call with you to determine your current level.
